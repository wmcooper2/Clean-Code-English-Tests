TODO

vocabularytab.py
-----------------
* make_vocabulary_tests(), check that the vocabulary test instance is reset each time in the "for loop" of.
* make function that also writes the answer key to vocabulary tests. The answer key should just be the opposite language of whatever language the words are in and should be in the correct order, matching the test version.
* when the vocab tests are made, duplicate words are appearing in the text file. Prevent duplicates from being written.
* add frame to the right of the questions per test frame, the button should create a list of vocabulary words based on the page range, grade level, and language  in alphabetical order for the teacher to have. (just another bell/whistle).
* The message box doesnt appear when the amount of words in test_words attribute dont have enough words. See also vocabularytabvalidation.py and vocabularytest.py.

vocabularytest.py
----------------
* The filtering by grade level is not working. The vocab .txt files are being populated with more words than should be available in the book for a given grade(1), page range ( 0  - 1 ), language (japanese), questions per test (50), number of tests (2).

sentencestab.py
---------------
* increase the width of the sentence input box and add a horizontal scrollbar.
* finish the noun_base_form search and display results.
* "running" has no results. Need to fix the search of verbforms because the raw data in "./data/verbforms.py" has "( )" in the values of the nested dictionaries.
* "was" is determined to be a noun with base "wa".

dictionaries.py
---------------
* fix set_entry() method. Add option to add entry when not found, and save it in a special file separate from the original dictionary so that reverting to the original set or excluding that special set is easier.
* am/is/are, was/were, do/does, fly/flies, have/has ... are the trouble words for verb base form searching. (fix base_verb_search()).
* move self.words, self.sort_words() to "lists.py", fix other connections in other files to these
* need to apply the same abilities of removing punctuation and numbers, case insensitivity too, when retrieving an entry.

words.py
--------
* further divide noun categories with new function for pronouns, proper nouns, common nouns, etc.
* finish writing tests to find base_nouns and base verbs

imagestab.py
-------------
* 'check.saved_message()' shows a different message.

juniorhighenglishwords.py
----------------------------
* check the books again to fill in the missing data points. words with (page number/ grade) = 1000, and remove the tuples nested convert to list  

maketests.py
------------
* prevent a potential issue with the make_vocabulary_test() method...if there aren't enough words to populate the list, then there may be a problem. Write a test for this.

studenttests.py
--------
* This one is really old code. Will take some work to refactor/repurpose.
* Move the methods into their own files named for their main tasks.


verbforms.py
-----------
* convert this stuff "run(s)" to "run, runs" to make searching for base forms easier.


Other
-----
* destroy the debug window after the program starts (for the final product)
* refactor _set_words_of_language_choice()
* Fix center-alignment on the widgets within the tabs. When inputting a large sentence in the sentence tab, the widgets maintain center alignment, but the other tabs are still left-aligned when you click over to them. Fix this.
